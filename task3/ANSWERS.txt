Q1. What is reused in your modified code, and what is it reused across?
In addition to the reuse in task 2:
I reuse oacts as I increment c many times.
I reuse a row of iacts as k is incremented.

I also now reuse wts since c only increments until the cache is full
and doesn't evict wts when more elements of wts are brought in. It can be reused
even if n changes.

Iacts is resued more since c only increments until the cache is full, and then it can stay to be reused
even if k changes.

Q2. Calculate the expected L1 data cache read miss rate in fc1 before and after your modifications. Explain in detail why you expect this miss rate; unsupported answers will receive no credit.

After task 2: (1/8 + 1/8 + 0)/3 = 1/12

After Task 3 modifications.
oacts still has a 0 miss rate
wts - initially 1/8 miss rate since each cache line has 8 elements, but with temporal reuse,
      each element is also reused



Q3. Explain any differences between your expected and measured L1 data cache read miss rates.

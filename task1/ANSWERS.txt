Q1. Consider the fc1 function. For each array that can be 
reused in the second loop, identify the array and which invariant
indices it is reused against.

wts can be reused, if k,c, is the invariant index.
iacts can be reused, c,n are invariant indices,
oacts can be reused, k, n are invariant indices. 


Q2. Consider the conv2 function. For each array that can be reused in the second loop, identify the array and which invariant indices it is reused against.
oacts can be reused if n, k, y, x are invariant indices
wts can be reused if k, c, s, r are invariant indices
iacts can be reused if n, c, y, s, x, r are invariant indices. 


Q3. In conv2, there is a reuse due to the fact that the value of a + b can be equal to the value of c + d for some values of a, b, c, and d. Identify this reuse and explain the reuse pattern as above.
iacts can be reused if when y+s is invariant or when x+r is invariant.

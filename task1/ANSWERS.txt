Q1. Consider the fc1 function. For each array that can be reused in the second loop, identify the array and which invariant indices it is reused against.



Q2. Consider the conv2 function. For each array that can be reused in the second loop, identify the array and which invariant indices it is reused against.



Q3. In conv2, there is a reuse due to the fact that the value of a + b can be equal to the value of c + d for some values of a, b, c, and d. Identify this reuse and explain the reuse pattern as above.
